You are given grouped error logs output from the group_error_logs tool. Your task is to extract trace/correlation IDs from this data to proceed with trace searching.

OBJECTIVE
Extract all valid trace/correlation IDs from the grouped error logs and prepare them for the next step: splunk_trace_search_by_ids.

INPUT FORMAT
You will receive JSON output from group_error_logs containing an array of error groups. Each group has this structure:
```json
{
  "pattern": "human-readable error pattern description",
  "template": "normalized message template",
  "count": number_of_events_in_group,
  "chosen_id": "selected trace/correlation ID",
  "all_ids": ["id1", "id2", "..."],
  "sample_events": [...]
}
```

EXTRACTION PROCESS

Step 1 — Collect chosen_id values
- Extract the "chosen_id" field from each group in the array
- These IDs were pre-selected as the most representative for each error pattern
- Skip any groups where chosen_id is null, empty, or just whitespace

Step 2 — Validate extracted IDs
- Ensure each ID is a non-empty string
- Remove any IDs that are clearly invalid (e.g., "null", "undefined", "N/A")
- Keep IDs that look like valid trace/correlation identifiers:
  * 32-character hex strings (OpenTelemetry trace IDs)
  * 16-character hex strings (span IDs)
  * UUID format (8-4-4-4-12 hex pattern)
  * Other alphanumeric correlation IDs (≥8 characters)

Step 3 — Deduplicate (optional but recommended)
- Remove duplicate IDs while preserving order
- Keep the first occurrence of each unique ID

Step 4 — Prepare for next step
- Count the total number of valid, unique IDs extracted
- Verify you have at least one valid ID to proceed

OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide your results in this exact format:

```
EXTRACTED TRACE IDs:
[List each ID on a separate line]

SUMMARY:
- Total groups processed: X
- Groups with valid IDs: Y
- Total unique IDs extracted: Z
- Groups skipped (no valid ID): W

NEXT STEP:
Call splunk_trace_search_by_ids with these parameters:
- trace_ids: [array of extracted IDs]
- earliest_time: "-24h" (or specify different time range)
- latest_time: "now"
- max_results: 4000 (or adjust as needed)
```

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
1. You MUST extract at least one valid trace ID to continue the debugging workflow
2. If no valid IDs are found, report this clearly and suggest reviewing the grouped logs for alternative ID fields
3. Preserve the exact format of extracted IDs (don't modify case or add/remove characters)
4. Be thorough but conservative - include IDs that look valid, exclude obvious non-IDs

WORKFLOW CONTEXT
This step bridges error pattern analysis with detailed trace investigation. The extracted IDs will be used to fetch complete trace data from Splunk, enabling root cause analysis across services and components.
