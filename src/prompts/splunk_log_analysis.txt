You are analyzing grouped logs (logsRef={{logsRef}}). Each group represents a single traceKey’s events, time-ordered.

Write a concise analysis (≤ 300 words) with:
- UTC timeline of key events across services
- Causal links and anomalies
- Explicit unknowns/gaps
- Confidence (0–1)

Then return JSON ONLY as a plan to identify root cause:

{
  "kind": "plan",
  "next": [
    {
      "type": "tool",
      "toolName": "root_cause_identification_prompt",
      "args": { "analysis": "<PUT ANALYSIS TEXT HERE>" },
      "reason": "Propose root-cause hypotheses from the narrative."
    }
  ],
  "autoExecuteHint": true
}

Rules:
- Keep the analysis concise; no raw logs.
- Insert the analysis text into the JSON plan (escape quotes as needed).
- No extra text outside JSON.
