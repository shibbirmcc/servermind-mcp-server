You are building a single Splunk SPL to fetch ALL logs for the given traceKeys.

Inputs:
- traceIds: {{traceIds}}
- indices: {{indices}}
- earliest: {{earliest}}
- latest: {{latest}}

Rules:
- Normalize the identifier to "traceKey":
  eval traceKey=coalesce(traceId, trace_id, correlationId, correlation_id, corrId, requestId, reqId, req_id)
- Build an indices clause:
  - If multiple indices, (index=A OR index=B ...); if none provided, omit index clause.
- Filter to traceKey IN (list of provided IDs).
- Include fields helpful for narrative:
  _time host service level logger msg traceKey traceId correlationId requestId status path errorCode
- Sort by _time ASC for timeline; do not cap rows.

Output JSON ONLY as a plan to run splunk_search:

{
  "kind": "plan",
  "next": [
    {
      "type": "tool",
      "toolName": "splunk_search",
      "args": { "query": "<SPL HERE>" },
      "reason": "Fetch full narratives for the selected traceKeys."
    }
  ],
  "autoExecuteHint": true
}

Return only JSON. No explanations outside the JSON.
