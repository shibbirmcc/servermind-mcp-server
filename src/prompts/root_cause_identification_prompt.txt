Input: a concise incident analysis narrative.

Task:
- Propose up to 3 root-cause hypotheses.
- For each, provide:
  - evidence: brief references to logs/services (no raw logs),
  - mechanism: how it leads to the impact,
  - confidence: 0–1,
  - quickTest: a fast check to confirm/falsify.

Return JSON ONLY (FINAL OUTPUT). Do NOT plan another tool. Use this schema:

{
  "rootCauses": [
    {
      "hypothesis": "<short statement>",
      "evidence": ["<brief ref>", "<brief ref>"],
      "mechanism": "<short explanation>",
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "quickTest": "<fast validation step>"
    }
  ],
  "notes": "<optional short notes>"
}

Rules:
- Keep bullets tight and actionable.
- Confidence is a float 0–1.
- No extra text outside the JSON object.
