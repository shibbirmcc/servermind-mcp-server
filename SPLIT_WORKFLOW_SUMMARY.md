# Group Error Logs Tool Split - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully split the `group_error_logs` tool into two focused tools to improve modularity and workflow clarity.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Tool: `extract_trace_ids_for_search`
**File**: `src/tools/extract_trace_ids_for_search.py`
- **Purpose**: Extract trace/correlation IDs from grouped error logs and prepare for trace search
- **Input**: JSON string output from `group_error_logs` containing grouped error patterns
- **Output**: Plan to call `splunk_trace_search_by_ids` with extracted trace IDs
- **Key Features**:
  - Validates and extracts `chosen_id` values from grouped logs
  - Deduplicates trace IDs (configurable)
  - Provides detailed extraction statistics
  - Handles error cases gracefully
  - Chains to `splunk_trace_search_by_ids` with `autoExecuteHint: true`

### 2. Modified Tool: `group_error_logs`
**File**: `src/tools/group_error_logs_prompt.py`
- **Updated Purpose**: Focus purely on semantic grouping of error logs
- **Key Changes**:
  - Removed direct chaining to `splunk_trace_search_by_ids`
  - Now chains to `extract_trace_ids_for_search` instead
  - Updated step info: "Step 5 → Step 5.5: Error Grouping → ID Extraction"
  - Simplified workflow responsibility

### 3. Updated Prompt
**File**: `src/prompts/group_error_logs_prompt.txt`
- Removed direct references to `splunk_trace_search_by_ids`
- Updated workflow continuation rules to mention "next step (ID extraction)"
- Maintained all core grouping logic and ID extraction requirements

### 4. Server Registration
**File**: `src/server.py`
- Added import for new `extract_trace_ids_for_search` tool
- Registered new MCP tool function
- Updated help text to include the new tool

## Workflow Chain
The new workflow follows this sequence:

```
Step 5: group_error_logs
  ↓ (chains to)
Step 5.5: extract_trace_ids_for_search  
  ↓ (chains to)
Step 6: splunk_trace_search_by_ids
```

## Benefits of the Split

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
- `group_error_logs`: Pure semantic grouping and ID selection
- `extract_trace_ids_for_search`: Pure ID extraction and validation

### 2. **Improved Modularity**
- Each tool can be used independently
- Easier to test and debug individual components
- More flexible workflow composition

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- Dedicated validation and error handling for ID extraction
- Clear separation of grouping vs. extraction failures
- More granular error reporting

### 4. **Enhanced Reusability**
- The grouping tool can be used without automatic trace search
- The extraction tool can work with any grouped logs JSON
- More flexible for different workflow scenarios

## Testing Results

The test script `test_split_workflow.py` confirms:
- ✅ Both tools execute successfully
- ✅ Proper workflow chaining: `group_error_logs` → `extract_trace_ids_for_search` → `splunk_trace_search_by_ids`
- ✅ Correct step numbering and workflow progression
- ✅ Proper JSON output format and structure
- ✅ Trace ID extraction and deduplication working correctly

## Tool Signatures

### group_error_logs
```python
async def group_error_logs(
    logs: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    max_groups: int = 10
) -> str
```

### extract_trace_ids_for_search
```python
async def extract_trace_ids_for_search(
    grouped_logs: str,
    deduplicate: bool = True,
    earliest_time: str = "-24h",
    latest_time: str = "now",
    max_results: int = 4000
) -> str
```

## Backward Compatibility
- The split maintains the same overall workflow behavior
- External users will see the same end-to-end functionality
- The intermediate step is transparent to the debugging workflow
- All existing workflow chains remain functional

## Files Modified
1. `src/tools/extract_trace_ids_for_search.py` (NEW)
2. `src/tools/group_error_logs_prompt.py` (MODIFIED)
3. `src/prompts/group_error_logs_prompt.txt` (MODIFIED)
4. `src/server.py` (MODIFIED)
5. `test_split_workflow.py` (NEW - for testing)

The refactoring successfully achieves the goal of splitting the monolithic tool into two focused, single-responsibility tools while maintaining the same workflow functionality.
